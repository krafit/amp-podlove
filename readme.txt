== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use this plugin as a standalone without the other AMP plugin? =
No. _AMP for Podlove_ needs both - AMP and Podlove to run properly.

= What is AMP? = 
AMP is [Google's new approach for a faster web](https://www.ampproject.org). Well it's HTML basically.

= Why is the web player looking so ugly? = 
The shiny Podlove web player uses a lot of JavaScript, CSS and magic. Due to performance we can not load all of this in AMP.
